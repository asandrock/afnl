This is the documentation of the \texttt{MODULE NumTypes}, that
contaions the definition of Single Precision, and Double
Precision data. All the other numerical modules uses this data type
definitions. 


\section{Description}

The \texttt{MODULE NumTypes} provides the definition of the Single
Precision and Double Precision real and complex data in a potable
way. When we want to define a single precision real we \emph{will} do
it with a statement like \texttt{Real (kind=DP)}, instead of
\texttt{Real (kind=4)}. What we mean with \texttt{DP} is defined in
this module. The different data types are:

\begin{description}
\item[SP: ] Single precision real.
\item[DP: ] Double precision real.
\item[SPC: ] Single precision complex.
\item[DPC: ] Double precision complex.
\end{description}

To make all the code as portable as possible, all the data
definitions should make use of this module.

\section{Examples}

Here we will define \texttt{A} as a single precision real, \texttt{D}
as a double precision real, \texttt{Ac} as a single precision complex,
and \texttt{Dc} as a double precision complex.

\begin{verbatim}
   .
   .
   USE NumTypes
   .
   .
   Real (kind=SP) :: A
   Real (kind=DP) :: D
   Complex (kind=SPC) :: Ac
   Complex (kind=DPC) :: Dc
   .
   .
\end{verbatim}
